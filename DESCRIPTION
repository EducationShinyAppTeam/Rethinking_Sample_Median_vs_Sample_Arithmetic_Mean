Description: An app for exploring and highlighting the differences between the Sample Median and Sample Arithmetic Mean
LearningObjectives: c("The student will understand that positioning the sample median and sample arithmetic mean aginst one another is a fallacy.","The student will learn that the visual skewness of a data visualization and the relative sizes of the values of the sample median and sample arithmetic mean can be misleading.","The student will learn that the adage 'right/positive skew means the mean is greater than the median' and it's complement are not universally true.")
